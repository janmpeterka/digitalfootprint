The importance of being able to identify users can be significant given a wide variety of applications in electronic commerce, such as product recommendation, personalized advertising, etc. We create user profiles capturing the strength of users' behavioral patterns, which can be used to identify users. Our experiments indicate that these profiles can be more accurate at identifying users than decision trees when sufficient web activities are observed, and can achieve higher efficiency than Support Vector Machines. The comparisons demonstrate that profile-based methods for user identification provide a viable and simple alternative to this problem.}

	abstract = {In March 2018, news of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal made headlines around the world. By inappropriately collecting data from approximately 87 million users’ Facebook profiles, the data analytics company, Cambridge Analytica, created psychographically tailored advertisements that allegedly aimed to influence people's voting preferences in the 2016 US presidential election. In the aftermath of this incident, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 30 participants based at a UK university, discussing their understanding of online privacy and how they manage it in the wake of the scandal. We analysed this data using an inductive (i.e. ‘bottom-up’) thematic analysis approach. Contrary to many opinions reported in the news, the respondents in our sample did not delete their accounts, frantically change their privacy settings, or even express that much concern. As a result, individuals often consider themselves immune to psychographically tailored advertisements, and lack understanding of how automated approaches and algorithms work in relation to their (and their networks’) personal data. We discuss our findings in relation to wider related research (e.g. crisis fatigue, networked privacy, Protection Motivation Theory) and discuss directions for future research.}

Additionally, repeated consumer data breaches have given people a sense of futility, ultimately making them weary of having to think about online privacy. This phenomenon is called “privacy fatigue.” Although privacy fatigue is prevalent and has been discussed by scholars, there is little empirical research on the phenomenon. This study aimed not only to conceptualize privacy fatigue but also to examine its role in online privacy behavior. Based on literature on burnout, we developed measurement items for privacy fatigue, which has two key dimensions —emotional exhaustion and cynicism. Data analyzed from a survey of 324 Internet users showed that privacy fatigue has a stronger impact on privacy behavior than privacy concerns do, although the latter is widely regarded as the dominant factor in explaining online privacy behavior.}

Traditional models of privacy are individualistic, but the realities of privacy reflect the location of individuals in contexts and networks. The affordances of social technologies, which enable people to share information about others, further preclude individual control over privacy. Despite this, social media technologies primarily follow technical models of privacy that presume individual information control. We argue that the dynamics of sites like Facebook have forced teens to alter their conceptions of privacy to account for the networked nature of social media. Drawing on their practices and experiences, we offer a model of networked privacy to explain how privacy is achieved in networked publics. }

The implications of the commercial and non-commercial use of young peoples' personal information are examined, with a specific focus on how this can potentially facilitate cyberbullying. The paper suggests that educational strategies should more clearly focus on encouraging young people to protect their online privacy, encourage control over disclosure practices, and consider the potential commercial and non-commercial uses of their information. There is a need for development of these strategies to be informed by empirical research exploring the everyday contexts and social norms which influence young peoples' online behaviour. Such an evidence-base can inform a critical review of educational, legal and regulatory actions which aim to protect their online privacy and safety.}

This article explores teenagers' practices of social networking in order to uncover the subtle connections between online opportunity and risk. While younger teenagers relish the opportunities to recreate continuously a highly-decorated, stylistically-elaborate identity, older teenagers favour a plain aesthetic that foregrounds their links to others, thus expressing a notion of identity lived through authentic relationships. The article further contrasts teenagers' graded conception of `friends' with the binary classification of social networking sites, this being one of several means by which online privacy is shaped and undermined by the affordances of these sites. }

	abstract = {Privacy relates to individuals and their ability to keep certain aspects of themselves away from other individuals and organisations. This leads both proponents and opponents of liberalism to argue that liberalism involves allowing individuals to determine for themselves the level of privacy they desire. If they are given adequate information and the ability to choose, the results are argued to be legitimate, even if individuals choose to bargain away all or most of their privacy in return for convenience, economic benefits, etc. However, the individualistic approach to privacy is insufficient, due to a set of externalities and information leakages involved in privacy issues. A crucial aspect of privacy is that it is an aggregate public good, and recognising this lets us see why government intervention is both beneficial and necessary for securing the provision of optimal levels of privacy. This conception of privacy enables us to treat it as a good that is underprovided due to market failure. The article shows how liberals can justify government interference for the protection of privacy by relying on the avoidance of harm, and not on paternalism or other arguments not easily reconcilable with liberalism.}

	Identity theft is a lot less dangerous and easier to perform, and therefore has flourished given the simplicity. Dumpster diving is a relatively safe and convenient method in which identity thieves can often obtain an abundance of information about anyone. Dumpster diving is not only a threat to consumers but also a threat to businesses and organizations. Identity theft can also takes place through social networking sites. This chapter presents one of the cases demonstrating the identity theft by social networking sites. On January 21, 2009, a person by the name of Bryan Rutberg had his Facebook account hijacked. A hijacker started sending e-mails indicating that Bryan had been robbed at gunpoint while traveling to overseas to the United Kingdom. The e-mail made mention that Bryan was in dire need of money in order to get home. The perpetrators had managed to change his Facebook log-in credentials so that he could no longer access his own page. Bryan decided to take an alternate route to trying to notify Facebook by reaching out to a cousin who happened to have a friend who worked for Facebook. It wasn't until that occurred when results started to take place, and the account was finally disabled after 40 hours.}

	abstract = {The field of information security is a fast-growing discipline. Even though the effectiveness of security measures to protect sensitive information is increasing, people remain susceptible to manipulation and thus the human element remains a weak link. A social engineering attack targets this weakness by using various manipulation techniques to elicit sensitive information. The field of social engineering is still in its early stages with regard to formal definitions, attack frameworks and templates of attacks. This paper proposes detailed social engineering attack templates that are derived from real-world social engineering examples. Current documented examples of social engineering attacks do not include all the attack steps and phases. The proposed social engineering attack templates attempt to alleviate the problem of limited documented literature on social engineering attacks by mapping the real-world examples to the social engineering attack framework. Mapping several similar real-world examples to the social engineering attack framework allows one to establish a detailed flow of the attack whilst abstracting subjects and objects. This mapping is then utilised to propose the generalised social engineering attack templates that are representative of real-world examples, whilst still being general enough to encompass several different real-world examples. The proposed social engineering attack templates cover all three types of communication, namely bidirectional communication, unidirectional communication and indirect communication. In order to perform comparative studies of different social engineering models, processes and frameworks, it is necessary to have a formalised set of social engineering attack scenarios that are fully detailed in every phase and step of the process. The social engineering attack templates are converted to social engineering attack scenarios by populating the template with both subjects and objects from real-world examples whilst still maintaining the detailed flow of the attack as provided in the template. Furthermore, this paper illustrates how the social engineering attack scenarios are applied to verify a social engineering attack detection model. These templates and scenarios can be used by other researchers to either expand on, use for comparative measures, create additional examples or evaluate models for completeness. Additionally, the proposed social engineering attack templates can also be used to develop social engineering awareness material.}

	abstract = {The growing use of social media among Internet users produces a vast and new source of user generated ecological data, such as textual posts and images, which can be collected for research purposes. The increasing convergence between social and computer sciences has led researchers to develop automated methods to extract and analyze these digital footprints to predict personality traits. These social media-based predictions can then be used for a variety of purposes, including tailoring online services to improve user experience, enhance recommender systems, and as a possible screening and implementation tool for public health. In this paper, we conduct a series of meta-analyses to determine the predictive power of digital footprints collected from social media over Big 5 personality traits. Further, we investigate the impact of different types of digital footprints on prediction accuracy. Results of analyses show that the predictive power of digital footprints over personality traits is in line with the standard “correlational upper-limit” for behavior to predict personality, with correlations ranging from 0.29 (Agreeableness) to 0.40 (Extraversion). Overall, our findings indicate that accuracy of predictions is consistent across Big 5 traits, and that accuracy improves when analyses include demographics and multiple types of digital footprints.}

	abstract = {The idea of using one's behavior with a pointing device, such as a mouse or a touchpad, as a behavioral biometric for authentication purposes has gained increasing attention over the past decade. A number of interesting approaches based on the idea have emerged in the literature and promising experimental results have been reported; however, we argue that limitations in the past experimental evaluations of these approaches raise questions about their true effectiveness in a practical setting. In this paper, we review existing authentication approaches based on mouse dynamics and shed light on some important limitations regarding how the effectiveness of these approaches has been evaluated in the past. We present the results of several experiments that we conducted to illustrate our observations and suggest guidelines for evaluating future authentication approaches based on mouse dynamics. We also discuss a number of avenues for additional research that we believe are necessary to advance the state of the art in this area.},

	abstract = {the need for a reliable and complementary identifier mechanism in a digital forensic analysis is the focus of this study. Mouse dynamics have been applied in information security studies, particularly, continuous authentication and authorization. However, the method applied in security is void of specific behavioral signature of a user, which inhibits its applicability in digital forensic science. This study investigated the likelihood of the observation of a unique signature from mouse dynamics of a computer user. An initial mouse path model was developed using non-finite automata. Thereafter, a set-theory based adaptive two-stage hash function and a multi-stage rule-based semantic algorithm were developed to observe the feasibility of a unique signature for forensic usage. An experimental process which comprises three existing mouse dynamics datasets were used to evaluate the applicability of the developed mechanism. The result showed a low likelihood of extracting unique behavioral signature which can be used in a user attribution process. Whilst digital forensic readiness mechanism could be a potential approach that can be used to achieve a reliable behavioral biometrics modality, the lack of unique signature presents a limitation. In addition, the result supports the logic that the current state of behavioral biometric modality, particularly mouse dynamics, is not suitable for forensic usage. Hence, the study concluded that whilst mouse dynamics-based behavioral biometrics may be a complementary modality in security studies, more will be required to adopt it as a forensic modality in litigation. Furthermore, the result from this study finds relevance in other human attributional studies such as user identification in recommender systems, e-commerce, and online profiling systems, where the degree of accuracy is not relatively high.}
